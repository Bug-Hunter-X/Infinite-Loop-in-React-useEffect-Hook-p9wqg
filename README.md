This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrect dependency array in the `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy component, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version.  The bug occurs because `setCount(count + 1)` inside the `useEffect` hook causes a re-render, which in turn triggers the `useEffect` again, creating an infinite loop. The solution involves correctly specifying dependencies or using a different approach altogether to manage state changes.
